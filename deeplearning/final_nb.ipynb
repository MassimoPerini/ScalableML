    "\n",
    "Let's start by building a one-layer neural network. Handwritten digits in the MNIST dataset are 28x28 pixel greyscale images. The simplest approach for classifying them is to use the 28x28=784 pixels as inputs for a **one-layer neural network**. Each neuron in the network does a weighted sum of all of its inputs, adds a bias and then feeds the result through some non-linear activation function. Here we design a one-layer neural network with 10 output neurons since we want to classify digits into 10 classes (0 to 9).\n",
    "<img src=\"figs/3-one_layer.png\" style=\"width: 400px;\"/>\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "For a classification problem, an *activation function* that works well is **softmax**. Applying softmax on a vector is done by taking the exponential of each element and then normalising the vector.\n",
    "<img src=\"figs/4-softmax.png\" style=\"width: 300px;\"/>\n",
    "\n",
    "We can summarise the behaviour of this single layer of neurons into a simple formula using a *matrix multiply*. If we give input data into the network in *mini-batch* of 100 images, it produces 100 predictions as the output. We define the **weights matrix $W$** with 10 columns, in which each column indicates the weight of a one class (a single digit), from 0 to 9. Using the first column of $W$, we can compute the weighted sum of all the pixels of the first image. This sum corresponds to the first neuron that points to the number 0. Using the second column of $W$, we do the same for the second neuron (number 1) and so on until the 10th neuron. We can then repeat the operation for the remaining 99 images in the mini-batch. If we call $X$ the matrix containing our 100 images (each row corresponds to one digit), all the weighted sums for our 10 neurons, computed on 100 images are simply $X.W$. Each neuron must now add its bias. Since we have 10 neurons, we have 10 bias constants. We finally apply the **softmax activation function** and obtain the formula describing a one-layer neural network, applied to 100 images.\n",

    "Then, we need to use the **cross-entropy** to measure how good the predictions are, i.e., the distance between what the network tells us and what we know to be the truth. The cross-entropy is a function of weights, biases, pixels of the training image and its known label. If we compute the partial derivatives of the cross-entropy relatively to all the weights and all the biases, we obtain a **gradient**, computed for a given image, label and present value of weights and biases. We can update weights and biases by a fraction of the gradient and do the same thing again using the next batch of training images.\n",

The neurons in the second layer, instead of computing weighted sums of pixels will compute weighted sums of neuron outputs from the previous layer. We keep the softmax function as the activation function on the last layer, but on intermediate layers we will use the the **sigmoid** activation function. So, let's build a five-layer fully connected neural network with the following structure, and train the model with the trainging data and print out its accuracy on the test data.\n",

    "# 4. Special Care for Deep Networks\n",
    "As layers were added, neural networks tended to converge with more difficulties. For example, the accuracy could stuck at 0.1. Here, we want to apply some updates to the network we built in the previous part to improve its performance. \n",
    "\n",
    "### ReLU Activation Function\n",
    "<img src=\"figs/10-comic3.png\" style=\"width: 500px;\"/>\n",
    "The sigmoid activation function is actually quite problematic in deep networks. It squashes all values between 0 and 1 and when you do so repeatedly, neuron outputs and their gradients can vanish entirely. An alternative activation function is **ReLU** that shows better performance compare to sigmoid. It looks like as below:\n",
    "<img src=\"figs/11-relu.png\" style=\"width: 300px;\"/>\n",
    "\n",
    "### A Better Optimizer\n",
    "In very high dimensional spaces like here, **saddle points** are frequent. These are points that are not local minima, but where the gradient is nevertheless zero and the gradient descent optimizer stays stuck there. One possible solution to tackle this probelm is to use better optimizers, such as Adam optimizer `tf.train.AdamOptimizer`.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Random Initialisations\n",
    "When working with ReLUs, the best practice is to initialise bias values to small positive values, so that neurons operate in the non-zero range of the ReLU initially.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Learning Rate\n",
    "<img src=\"figs/12-comic4.png\" style=\"width: 500px;\"/>\n",
    "With two, three or four intermediate layers, you can now get close to 98% accuracy, if you push the iterations to 5000 or beyond. But, the results are not very consistent, and the curves jump up and down by a whole percent. A good solution is to start fast and decay the learning rate exponentially from $0.005$ to $0.0001$ for example. In order to pass a different learning rate to the `AdamOptimizer` at each iteration, you will need to define a new placeholder and feed it a new value at each iteration through `feed_dict`. Here is the formula for exponential decay: $learning\\_rate = lr\\_min + (lr\\_max - lr\\_min) * e^{\\frac{-i}{2000}}$, where $i$ is the iteration number.\n",
    "\n",
    "### NaN?\n",
    "In the network you built in the last section, you might see accuracy curve crashes and the console outputs NaN for the cross-entropy. It may happen, because you are attempting to compute a $log(0)$, which is indeed Not A Number (NaN). Remember that the cross-entropy involves a log, computed on the output of the softmax layer. Since softmax is essentially an exponential, which is never zero, we should be fine, but with 32 bit precision floating-point operations, exp(-100) is already a genuine zero. TensorFlow has a handy function that computes the softmax and the cross-entropy in a single step, implemented in a numerically stable way. To use it, you will need to separate the weighted sum plus bias on the last layer, before softmax is applied and then give it with the true values to the function `tf.nn.softmax_cross_entropy_with_logits`.\n",

    "* Initialize weights with small random values between -0.2 and +0.2, and make sure biases are initialised with small positive values, for example 0.1\n",

    "<img src=\"figs/13-comic5.png\" style=\"width: 500px;\"/>\n",
    "You will have noticed that cross-entropy curves for test and training data start disconnecting after a couple thousand iterations. The learning algorithm works on training data only and optimises the training cross-entropy accordingly. It never sees test data so it is not surprising that after a while its work no longer has an effect on the test cross-entropy which stops dropping and sometimes even bounces back up. \n",
    "<img src=\"figs/14-overfit.png\" style=\"width: 500px;\"/>\n",
    "This disconnect is usually labeled **overfitting** and when you see it, you can try to apply a regularisation technique called **dropout**. In dropout, at each training iteration, you drop random neurons from the network. You choose a probability `pkeep` for a neuron to be kept, usually between 50% and 75%, and then at each iteration of the training loop, you randomly remove neurons with all their weights and biases. Different neurons will be dropped at each iteration. When testing the performance of your network of course you put all the neurons back (`pkeep = 1`).\n",
    "<img src=\"figs/15-dropout.png\" style=\"width: 500px;\"/>\n",
    "TensorFlow offers a dropout function to be used on the outputs of a layer of neurons. It randomly zeroes-out some of the outputs and boosts the remaining ones by `1 / pkeep`. You can add dropout after each intermediate layer in the network now. \n",
    "\n",
    "In the following code, use the dropout between each layer during the training, and set the probability `pkeep` once to $50%$ and another time to $75%$ and compare their results."

    "<img src=\"figs/16-comic6.png\" style=\"width: 500px;\"/>\n",
    "In the previous sections, all pixels of images flattened into a single vector, which was a really bad idea. Handwritten digits are made of shapes and we discarded the shape information when we flattened the pixels. However, we can use **convolutional neural networks (CNN)** to take advantage of shape information. CNNs apply *a series of filters* to the raw pixel data of an image to extract and learn higher-level features, which the model can then use for classification. CNNs contains three components:\n",
    "  - **Convolutional layers**: apply a specified number of convolution filters to the image. For each subregion, the layer performs a set of mathematical operations to produce a single value in the output feature map. Convolutional layers then typically apply a ReLU activation function to the output to introduce nonlinearities into the model.\n",
    "  - **Pooling layers**: downsample the image data extracted by the convolutional layers to reduce the dimensionality of the feature map in order to decrease processing time. A commonly used pooling algorithm is max pooling, which extracts subregions of the feature map (e.g., 2x2-pixel tiles), keeps their maximum value, and discards all other values.\n",
    "  - **Dense (fully connected) layers**: perform classification on the features extracted by the convolutional layers and downsampled by the pooling layers. In a dense layer, every node in the layer is connected to every node in the preceding layer.\n",
    "  \n",
    "Typically, a CNN is composed of a *stack of **convolutional modules*** that perform feature extraction. Each *module* consists of a *convolutional layer* followed by a *pooling layer*. The last convolutional module is followed by one or more dense layers that perform classification. The final dense layer in a CNN contains a single neuron for each target class in the model, with a softmax activation function to generate a value between 0-1 for each neuron. We can interpret the softmax values for a given image as relative measurements of how likely it is that the image falls into each target class.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now, let us build a convolutional network for handwritten digit recognition. In this assignment, we will use the architecture shown in the following figure that has three convolutional layers, one fully-connected layer, and one softmax layer. Notice that the second and third convolutional layers have a stride of two that explains why they bring the number of output values down from 28x28 to 14x14 and then 7x7. A convolutional layer requires a weights tensor like `[4, 4, 3, 2]`, in which the first two numbers define the size of a filter (map), the third number shows the *depth* of the filter that is the number of *input channel*, and the last number shows the number of *output channel*. The output channel defines the number of times that we repeat the same thing with a different set of weights in one layer. In our implementation, we assume the output depth of first three convolutional layers, are 4, 8, 12, and the size of fully connected layer is 200.\n",
    "<img src=\"figs/17-arch1.png\" style=\"width: 600px;\"/>\n",
    "\n",
    "Convolutional layers can be implemented in TensorFlow using the `tf.nn.conv2d` function, which performs the scanning of the input image in both directions using the supplied weights. This is only the weighted sum part of the neuron. You still need to add a bias and feed the result through an activation function. The padding strategy that works here is to copy pixels from the sides of the image. All digits are on a uniform background so this just extends the background and should not add any unwanted shapes."

    "# 7. Improve The Performance\n",
    "A good approach to sizing your neural networks is to implement a network that is a little too constrained, then give it a bit more degrees of freedom and add dropout to make sure it is not overfitting. This ends up with a fairly optimal network for your problem. In the above model, we set the output channel to 4 in the first convolutional layer, which means that we repeat the same filter shape (but with different weights) four times. If we assume that those filters evolve during training into shape recognisers, you can intuitively see that this might not be enough for our problem. Handwritten digits are made from more than 4 elemental shapes. So let us bump up the filter sizes a little, and also increase the number of filters in our convolutional layers from 4, 8, 12 to 6, 12, 24 and then add dropout on the fully-connected layer. The following figure shows the new architecture you should build. Please complete the following code based on the given architecture and dropout technique.\n",

To do so, first you need to use **OpenCV** library to make the images ready to give as input to the model. OpenCV is a library used for image processing. Below you can see how to read an image file and pre-process it using OpenCV to give it to the model. However, you need to complete the code and test the accuracy of your model.
